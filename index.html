    I'm your cool new webpage. Made with
    <a href="/about.html">Go to About</a>
    It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to
    change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness, and
    could not, for the life of him, tell whether he held the sheep right side
    up, or upside down. But that point was decided for him a moment later by the
    animal itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his
    lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust. She patiently waited
    for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had
    insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it
    was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She
    would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here
    she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called. She reached her
    goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she
    thought she'd feel upon reaching it wasn't there. Something wasn't right.
    Was this the only feeling she'd have for over five years of hard work?
    Sometimes it's simply better to ignore the haters. That's the lesson that
    Tom's dad had been trying to teach him, but Tom still couldn't let it go. He
    latched onto them and their hate and couldn't let it go, but he also
    realized that this wasn't healthy. That's when he came up with his devious
    plan. He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry
    knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible.
    Bounding down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in
    a panic. There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed
    neatly on the steps he had just come down. Had he past them without seeing
    them? It didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a
    deep chill filled his body.
